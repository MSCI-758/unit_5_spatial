Before using information obtained from this server, special attention should be given to the date and time of the data and products being displayed. This information shall not be modified in content and then presented as official government material. This dataset was created to depict the boundaries of NMFS Regulated Areas in the US Atlantic EEZ (Regulated Areas) only.  The dataset should not be used for a legal definition.  The dataset should not be used to infer information regarding the existence or details of other marine features or resources, including, but not limited to, navigable waters, coastlines, bathymetry, submerged features, or man-made structures.  Users assume responsibility for determining the appropriate use of this dataset. *** Not the Legal Definition *** This Geographic Information System (GIS) dataset is not the legal definition of the Regulated Area. The description published in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations is the only legal definition.  This dataset and metadata document provide a broad overview of a subset of applicable fishing regulations, restrictions and requirements; it is not a substitute for the actual regulations. Users are encouraged to read the applicable regulations in conjunction with use of this dataset.   *** Temporal Considerations *** Regulated Area boundary definitions are subject to change or modification.  Published datasets may represent historic, current, or future Regulated Areas.  When changes to fishing regulations affect this dataset, it will be archived and replaced by an updated version as soon as feasible.  Approved Regulated Area boundaries may also be published prior to their effective date.  It is the user’s responsibility to ensure the applicable Regulated Area boundaries are being used.   *** Shorelines/Base Layers *** The accuracy of this dataset is dependent upon the accuracy and resolution of the datasets (e.g., shoreline, bathymetry, shared administrative boundaries) used in the creation process. Source datasets used are specified in the metadata.  These data sources were selected for their suitability to a broad audience, and may not be suitable for specific uses requiring higher-resolution information.  Coastlines change.  Unless otherwise noted, where the NOAA Medium Resolution Shoreline is used, assume the regulatory boundary reaches the most current coastline delineation available.</useconst><descript><abstract>This dataset depicts the boundaries of the North Atlantic Right Whale Critical Habitat in ESRI shapefile format for the NOAA Fisheries Service’s Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO).  This shapefile includes boundaries for the following Regulated Areas:  - Critical Habitat for North Atlantic Right Whale Unit 1  - Critical Habitat for North Atlantic Right Whale Unit 2 Please Note: Unit 1, in the Gulf of Maine, falls under the jurisdiction of the NOAA Fisheries Greater Atlantic Region.  Unit 2, off the southeastern US coast, falls under the jurisdiction of the NOAA Fisheries Southeast Region. Because GIS projection and topology functions can change or generalize coordinates, these GIS files are considered to be approximate representations and are NOT an OFFICIAL record for the exact regulated area boundaries.  For information on the official legal definition refer to the Use Constraints metadata section.</abstract><purpose>Beginning in 2010 and in response to mounting requests for digital depictions of NMFS Regulated Areas in the US Atlantic EEZ (Regulated Areas), the NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office (GARFO) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Committee launched a project to standardize the development, publication and regular updating of GIS files depicting Regulated Area boundaries.  This dataset is a product of that initiative.  This dataset was created to depict the boundaries of NMFS Regulated Areas in the US Atlantic EEZ (Regulated Areas) only.  For information on the proper use of the dataset refer to the Use Constraints metadata section.</purpose><supplinf>Unit 1, in the Gulf of Maine, falls under the jurisdiction of the NOAA Fisheries Greater Atlantic Region.

To standardize Regulated Area features sharing these boundaries, published shapefiles of the shared administrative boundaries were obtained from the authoritative agencies.  A shoreline was selected that was suitable for general mapping purposes, freely and publicly available, of medium-resolution, and covering the extent of the U.S..  When necessary, the boundaries were transformed to NAD83. A series of template polygon shapefiles were then generated, using these authoritative boundaries as the outward extents of the polygon.  All templates were generated in NAD83 geographic coordinate system.  The templates created are: 1) Coast-to-EEZ: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida (an arbitrary cut-off for the Atlantic); 2) Coast-to-SLA: bounded by the coastline, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the Submerged Lands Act boundary, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida; 3) SLA-to-EEZ: bounded by the Submerged Lands Act boundary, the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary, the U.S. EEZ, and 81°W longitude off the southern extent of Florida.  These templates were subsequently copied and edited, as needed by the Regulated Area spatial definitions.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Get Definition Text] The spatial definition for the Regulated Area was copied from the Final Rule, as published in the Federal Register. (This spatial definition will be legally codified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) on the Final Rule's Effective Date. After that point, the CFR (or the e-CFR website) may be accessed for the legal spatial definition. The attribute table includes Federal Register citations for the rule establishing this area, and its Effective Date.)</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Features From Templates] The Coast-to-EEZ template shapefile was copied and projected to NAD83 Mercator Projection.  The coordinates of the Regulated Area definition were transferred to a spreadsheet, converted to Decimal Degrees, plotted as a point shapefile in NAD83, and then projected to NAD83 Mercator Projection.  To generate the Regulated Area boundary in ArcGIS, the template polygon was split by connecting these points in the order specified in the spatial definition.  When the spatial definition specified that points were connected by following the Coastline, the coinciding outward extent of the template polygon was used.  When the spatial definition specified that points were connected by following a straight line, rhumb lines were constructed.  As an exception, points intended to fall along the U.S.-Canada Maritime Boundary were connected by following the geodesic line that legally defines that international boundary.  After all points were appropriately connected, any portions of the template outside the defined Regulated Area were discarded.  When multiple Regulated Areas are a part of a larger grouping of related Regulated Areas, these steps were repeated to generate a unique feature for each Regulated Area and the features were then combined into a single shapefile.  The boundaries were densified with consecutive vertices spaced no more than 10 nautical miles apart, to preserve rhumb line paths in other coordinate systems.  The file was projected back to the un-projected NAD83 coordinate system.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[COLREGS] Where specified in the Regulated Area definition, inshore and offshore waters were separated following COLREGS lines.  These inlet/bay crossings were drawn after consulting a combination of a) the COLREGS definitions in 33 CFR 80, b) the NOAA Coastal Services Center COLREGS shapefile, and c) the NOAA Medium Resolution Shoreline shapefile because COLREGS lines described by a single source may not always fully cross the specified waterway as depicted by the source shoreline data set.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Combine Features] The Unit 1 (produced by the Greater Atlantic Regional Fisheries Office) and Unit 2 (produced by the Southeast Regional Office) boundaries were merged into a single shapefile.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Add Attributes] The standardized attribute schema was applied to the shapefile, and the fields were defined.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Check Geometry] The ESRI ArcGIS Check Geometry tool was run on the shapefile to identify any geometry problems.  If problems were encountered, they were reviewed and corrected.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>2016</procdate><procdesc>[Final Review] The shapefile was reviewed by members of the GARFO GIS Committee, policy experts from the GARFO Division responsible for the Regulated Area, and General Counsel, according to the GARFO GIS Data Distribution Policy.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>20160126</procdate><procdesc>[Publication] The shapefile, with accompanying metadata, was uploaded for public download on the NOAA NMFS GARFO GIS website.</procdesc></procstep><srcinfo><typesrc>online</typesrc><srccitea>Federal Register</srccitea><srccontr>Final Rule containing spatial definitions for Regulated Area boundaries.</srccontr><srctime><srccurr>publication date</srccurr><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20160127</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></srctime><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)</origin><title>Federal Register</title><edition>Volume 81; Number 17; Page 4838</edition><geoform>document</geoform><othercit>Final Rule titled "Endangered and Threatened Species; Critical Habitat for Endangered North Atlantic Right Whale "</othercit><pubdate>20160127</pubdate><pubinfo><publish>The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration</publish><pubplace>Washington, DC</pubplace></pubinfo><onlink>https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-01-27/pdf/2016-01633.pdf</onlink><onlink>https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2016/01/27/2016-01633/endangered-and-threatened-species-critical-habitat-for-endangered-north-atlantic-right-whale</onlink><onlink>https://www.federalregister.gov/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite></srcinfo><srcinfo><typesrc>digital download (ESRI shapefile)</typesrc><srccitea>US EEZ</srccitea><srccontr>This source  marine boundary was used to generate template shapefiles, which were copied and used when Regulatory Area boundaries followed portions of the US Exclusive Economic Zone.</srccontr><srctime><srccurr>publication date</srccurr><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>20110501</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo></srctime><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS)</origin><title>USMaritimeLimitsNBoundaries</title><edition>1</edition><geoform>vector digital data</geoform><pubdate>20110501</pubdate><pubinfo><publish>NOAA's Ocean Service, Office of Coast Survey (OCS)</publish><pubplace>Silver Spring, MD</pubplace></pubinfo><onlink>http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/csdl/mbound.htm</onlink></citeinfo></srccite></srcinfo><srcinfo><srcscale>70000</srcscale><typesrc>digital download (ESRI shapefile)</typesrc><srccitea>NOAA Medium Resolution Shoreline</srccitea><srccontr>This source shoreline was used to generate template shapefiles, which were copied and used when Regulatory Area boundaries followed portions of the US Atlantic coastline.
